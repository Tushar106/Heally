# Problem statement

Doctors are lifesavers and that is why they shouldnâ€™t be too far from
those who need healthcare. With more and more people having the need to seek medical attention, doctors need to make their services accessible and available to their patients. In this time and age where everything and anything can be found on the internet, we need to take advantage of the digital tools/ channels to enable quick scheduling of appointments.

## Goals

The problem solution should satisfy some goal which are

- Find availability of all doctors basis their specialty
- Ability to find doctors near your location with doctors list sorted basis the shortest distance
- Book the appointment and receive confirmation notification in the app.
- There shall not be any conflicting consultation for the doctors/patients at the booked time slots.
- Reminder notification one hour before the appointment time with a link to driving
directions to doctorâ€™s clinic

# Proposed solution

The Heally app will be developed using React Native, ensuring a smooth and consistent user experience across both iOS and Android platforms. This choice of technology allows for efficient development and maintenance of a single codebase for multiple platforms.

Key features of the Heally mobile app will include:

- User-friendly interface for patients to search and filter doctors by specialty and location
- Real-time availability tracking and appointment booking system
- Integrated map functionality to show doctor locations and provide directions
- Push notification system for appointment confirmations and reminders

**What is the high level data model?**

The high-level data model for the Heally app will be implemented using Firebase Firestore. The database will consist of two main collections: 'appointments' and 'users'. Here's a breakdown of each collection:

### Appointments Collection

```json
{
  "address": "",
  "date": "",
  "doctorID": "",
  "doctorName": "",
  "patientID": "",
  "patientName": "",
  "status": "",
  "time": ""
}
```

This structure allows for efficient tracking of appointments, including all necessary details about the doctor, patient, and scheduling information.

### Users Collection

```json
{
  "about": "",
  "address": "",
  "appointments": [],
  "email": "",
  "fees": "",
  "isDoctor": false,
  "name": "",
  "profileImage": "",
  "speciality": "",
  "userID": ""
}
```

This structure accommodates both patient and doctor profiles, with the 'isDoctor' field determining the user type. The 'appointments' array can store references to the user's appointments, enabling quick access to a user's appointment history.

This data model allows for efficient querying and real-time updates, which are crucial for features like appointment booking and availability tracking. The structure also supports scalability and future feature additions.
