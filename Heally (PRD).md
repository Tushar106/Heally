# Product Requirements Description

# ðŸ‘€Â Problem

> **Problem Statement**
> 
> 
> 
> Doctors are lifesavers and that is why they shouldnâ€™t be too far from
> those who need healthcare. With more and more people having the need to seek medical attention, doctors need to make their services accessible and available to their patients. In this time and age where everything and anything can be found on the internet, we need to take advantage of the digital tools/ channels to enable quick scheduling of appointments.
> 
> We must envisage and develop a digital solution to give patients the freedom to book the appointments at any time and from anywhere with ease.
> 

The problem solution should satisfy some goal which are

- Find availability of all doctors basis their specialty
- Ability to find doctors near your location with doctors list sorted basis the shortest distance
- Book the appointment and receive confirmation notification in the app.
- There shall not be any conflicting consultation for the doctors/patients at the booked time slots.
- Reminder notification one hour before the appointment time with a link to driving
directions to doctorâ€™s clinic

# ðŸ’­Â Proposal

To solve this problem, we propose a solution consisting of a **mobile App named Heally**.

> The Heally app will be developed using React Native, ensuring a smooth and consistent user experience across both iOS and Android platforms. This choice of technology allows for efficient development and maintenance of a single codebase for multiple platforms.
> 

Key features of the Heally mobile app will include:

- User-friendly interface for patients to search and filter doctors by specialty and location
- Real-time availability tracking and appointment booking system
- Integrated map functionality to show doctor locations and provide directions
- Push notification system for appointment confirmations and reminders

In addition to the mobile app, we will develop a web-based platform for doctor registration and management. This website will be built using React for the frontend and a robust backend framework like Node.js with Express. Key features of the web platform will include:

- Doctor registration and profile management
- Scheduling system for doctors to set their availability
- Dashboard for doctors to view and manage appointments
- Analytics tools to track patient engagement and appointment statistics

We have considered alternatives such as developing separate native apps for iOS and Android, but chose React Native for its cost-effectiveness and faster development cycle. The web platform for doctor registration was deemed necessary to provide a comprehensive solution that addresses both patient and doctor needs.

To ensure scalability and performance, we will implement the following measures:

- Use of cloud-based infrastructure for flexible scaling
- Optimization of API calls and data transfer between the app and server
- Regular performance testing and optimization

This comprehensive solution will address the problem statement by providing an easily accessible platform for patients to find and book appointments with doctors, while also giving doctors the tools they need to manage their schedules effectively.

# ðŸ›«Â Plan

To develop the solution in given time, we can mainly divide the work into three spheres

1. Website (**React**, **TypeScript, Vite**)
2. App (**React-Native**)
3. App-Server (**Pyhtonâ€”>Flask**)

Here's a detailed plan for developing the Heally app within a 3-day timeframe:

## Day 1: Setup and Core Development

### Website (React, TypeScript, Vite)

- Set up the project using Vite with React and TypeScript
- Develop the basic structure for doctor registration and login
- Create a dashboard layout for doctors to manage their profiles and schedules

### App (React-Native)

- Initialize the React Native project
- Implement the user interface for patient registration and login
- Design the main screen for searching doctors by specialty and location

### App-Server (Pythonâ€”>Flask)

- Set up the Flask project structure
- Implement basic API endpoints for user authentication (both doctors and patients)
- Create database models for doctors, patients, and appointments

## Day 2: Feature Implementation

### Website

- Implement the scheduling system for doctors to set their availability
- Develop the appointment management interface
- Add basic analytics for patient engagement and appointment statistics

### App

- Integrate map functionality to display doctor locations
- Implement the appointment booking system
- Add push notification setup for appointment confirmations and reminders

### App-Server

- Develop API endpoints for doctor search and filtering
- Create endpoints for retrieving doctor availability

## Day 3: Integration and Deployment

### Integration

- Connect the website and app to the backend server
- Implement real-time updates for doctor availability
- Integrate the notification system across all platforms

### Deployment

- Deploy the backend server to a cloud platform (Heroku)
- Publish the website to a web hosting service
- Submit the app to Judges of Hackathon

This aggressive timeline assumes a small, highly skilled team working intensively. It's important to note that this schedule may need to be adjusted based on unforeseen challenges or complexities that arise during development.

## Future Goals

As we continue to develop and improve Heally, we have identified several key areas for future expansion and enhancement:

- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Implement a secure payment system to allow patients to pay for appointments directly through the app, improving convenience and reducing no-shows.
- **Web-Telehealth Solution:** Develop a robust telehealth platform to provide access to healthcare from anywhere, enabling virtual consultations between patients and doctors.
- **AWS Medical Comprehend Integration:** Utilize AWS Medical Comprehend to enhance our ability to process and analyze medical information, potentially improving diagnosis accuracy and treatment recommendations.
- **Advanced Appointment Management:** Implement features for appointment status updates, including cancellations, delays, and rescheduling options, to improve communication between patients and healthcare providers.

These future goals will help Heally evolve into a more comprehensive healthcare solution, addressing a wider range of patient and doctor needs while leveraging cutting-edge technologies to improve healthcare delivery and accessibility.
